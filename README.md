# Sprint_3_patterns

ðŸ“„ EXERCISES DESCRIPTION

LEVELS 1

- Exercise 1 - Singleton
Refactor the Tigger class into a Singleton considering the following points:
    * Define the getInstance() method. This function is responsible for creating an instance of the Tigger class only once and returning that single instance each time it is called.
    * Print Tigger's roar multiple times to the screen.
    * Add a getCounter() method that returns the number of times Tigger has roared.

- Exercise 2 - Dependency Injection
Imagine you are a person who is about to leave home to go to study/work. Before leaving home you will need to bring your wallet, house keys, maybe car/motorcycle keys or public transport card, and smartphone. Write a program that simulates this logic using the dependency injection pattern.
