# Sprint_3_patterns

ðŸ“„ EXERCISES DESCRIPTION

LEVEL 1

SNGLETON
Refactor the Tigger class into a Singleton considering the following points:
* Define the getInstance() method.
* Print Tigger's roar multiple times to the screen.
* Add a getCounter() method that returns the number of times Tigger has roared.

DEPENDENCY INJECTION
Imagine you are a person who is about to leave home to go to study/work. 
You will need to bring your wallet, house keys, maybe car/motorcycle keys or public transport card, and smartphone. 
Write a program that simulates this logic using the dependency injection pattern.

LEVEL 2

ADAPTER
Given the class Duck and the class Turkey, you want your turkeys to behave like ducks.
Implement the adapter pattern. In the same file, write a class called TurkeyAdapter. 
Translating quack between classes is easy: just call the Gobble method when appropriate.
Although both classes have a fly method, turkeys can only fly in short bursts.
To map between a duck's fly method and a turkey's fly method, the turkey's fly method must be called five times. 
Test your class with the given code.

FACADE
When we wash dishes (by hand), we generally take a piece of laundry, soap it, rinse it, and place it in the dryer.
These steps are fully automated with an automatic dishwasher. Implement this logic using the Facade pattern.
